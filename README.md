## Hi :)

I'm Fedor Splitt, a student researcher with the [XplaiNLP](https://xplainlp.github.io/) team at TU Berlin,
currently working on counterfactuals and cross-lingual & multilingual intent recognition in conversational XAI systems.

I recently co-developed a small planning poker tool as well, [check it out!](https://planningpoker.fun)
