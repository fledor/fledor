## Hi :)

I'm a student researcher with the [XplaiNLP](https://xplainlp.github.io/) team at TU Berlin,
currently working on cross-lingual and multilingual intent recognition in conversational XAI systems.

At the moment I'm developing a small planning poker [tool](https://planningpoker.fun) as well
